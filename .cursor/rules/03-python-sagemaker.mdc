Python coding standards for Leanda.io:
- Python 3.12+, use uv or rye for dependency management
- Strict typing: always use type hints + Pydantic v2 for models
- Prefer Polars over pandas when working with large scientific datasets
- Use boto3.session when needed, but prefer high-level SDKs (SageMaker SDK, awswrangler)
- Structure: domain-driven (src/domain_name/services/, tests/, features/)
- Testing: pytest + pytest-asyncio + moto for AWS mocking
- Logging: structured logging with structlog
- Always handle pagination & retries with tenacity
