Workspace organization standards for Leanda.io:

## Archive Folder Structure
- Save ALL temporary/exploratory scripts to `.archive/` folder (gitignored)
- Use `.archive/scripts/` for one-off utility scripts (migrate-*, analyze-*, fix-*, explore-*)
- Use `.archive/reports/` for in-progress markdown reports and analysis
- Use `.archive/notebooks/` for exploratory Jupyter notebooks
- Use `.archive/experiments/` for ML experiments and prototypes
- Use `.archive/migrations/` for one-time data migration scripts

## Naming Conventions
- Prefix WIP reports with date: `YYYY-MM-DD-report-name.md`
  - Example: `2025-01-15-cost-analysis.md`
  - Example: `2025-01-15-migration-plan.md`
- Prefix temp scripts with purpose: `migrate-*`, `analyze-*`, `fix-*`, `explore-*`
  - Example: `migrate-mongodb-to-docdb.py`
  - Example: `analyze-s3-costs.py`
  - Example: `fix-data-quality-issues.py`
- Include author initials for team attribution: `2025-01-15-rz-cost-analysis.md`
- Add `_DRAFT` suffix for incomplete documents: `architecture-proposal_DRAFT.md`

## Archive Lifecycle
- Review `.archive/` contents monthly for promotion or deletion
- Promote valuable scripts to proper `src/` locations with tests
- Promote finalized reports to `docs/` with proper formatting
- Delete obsolete artifacts older than 90 days
- Never reference `.archive/` files from production code

## In-Progress Reports
- Create analysis reports in `.archive/reports/` while researching
- Use clear headers: `## Status`, `## Findings`, `## Next Steps`, `## Open Questions`
- Move to `docs/` only when complete and reviewed
- Include data sources and methodology for reproducibility
- Document assumptions and limitations

## Temporary Scripts
- Add shebang and docstring explaining purpose:
  ```python
  #!/usr/bin/env python3
  """
  One-time script to migrate MongoDB data to DocumentDB.
  
  Usage: python migrate-mongodb-to-docdb.py --source-uri <uri> --target-uri <uri>
  """
  ```
- Include cleanup instructions if script modifies data
- Never commit credentials even in archived scripts (use environment variables)
- Mark destructive operations clearly with warnings:
  ```python
  # WARNING: This script will DELETE data. Review carefully before running.
  ```
- Add dry-run mode for destructive operations

## Notebook Organization
- Use Jupyter notebooks in `.archive/notebooks/` for exploratory analysis
- Clear outputs before committing (if notebook is promoted to docs)
- Include markdown cells explaining methodology and findings
- Document data sources and assumptions
- Convert to scripts or reports when analysis is complete

## Migration Scripts
- Store one-time migration scripts in `.archive/migrations/`
- Include rollback instructions in script comments
- Test migrations on staging environment first
- Document migration steps and expected downtime
- Archive successful migrations (don't delete, mark as completed)

## Best Practices
- Never commit `.archive/` contents to version control (gitignored)
- Use `.archive/` for work-in-progress, not for permanent documentation
- Promote valuable content to proper locations (src/, docs/) when ready
- Review and clean up `.archive/` regularly (monthly review)
- Document archive conventions in `.archive/README.md`
