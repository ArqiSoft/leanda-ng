Java standards for Leanda.io backend services:
- Java 25 LTS + Quarkus 3.15+ (native compilation preferred for Lambda)
- Use records, sealed classes, pattern matching
- REST: RESTEasy Reactive + OpenAPI v3
- Reactive: Mutiny everywhere possible
- Testing: QuarkusTest + RestAssured + WireMock
- Dependency injection: always use @Inject, avoid statics
- Follow hexagonal/clean architecture
- Always validate inputs with Hibernate Validator + Bean Validation
